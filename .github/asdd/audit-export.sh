# ASDD - export the run's audit records to the adopter's own private sink.
#
# ASDD hosts nothing. Records are produced in the adopter's pipeline (read-only, into the run directory)
# and this step ships them to a sink the ADOPTER owns. It runs in the WRITE-SCOPED publish context and
# reads only ASDD-produced records, never untrusted pull-request content, so the sink credential is never
# present in a job that processes a fork's input. That is the same split as intake/publish.
#
# Two refusals are hard, because getting them wrong publishes the trail:
#   1. The sink must not be the repository being governed.
#   2. The sink must not be public.
# Either one fails loudly rather than exporting.
