# ASDD - GENERIC runtime adapter (bring your own OpenAI-compatible model). Safe by construction.
#
# Two rules keep the pipeline conformant, both demonstrated here:
#   - Untrusted PR content is assembled into the prompt as a FENCED DATA BLOCK, separate from the fixed
#     instructions, and the model is told to treat it as inert. Output is captured as DATA, validated as
#     JSON, never executed.
#   - The adversarial QUALITY lens runs as a SEPARATE inference from the code/security/spec lenses, in
#     its own context, so it cannot see (and rubber-stamp) their conclusions. Structural, not just wording.
#
# Wiring: ASDD_MODEL_CMD is a command that reads a prompt on stdin and prints review JSON on
# stdout. If unset but ASDD_MODEL_URL is set, it defaults to the bundled openai-compat helper.
# Unset and no URL => a labelled template review so the pipeline still completes. No GitHub write scope.
