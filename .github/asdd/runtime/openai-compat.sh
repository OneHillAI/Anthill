# ASDD - OpenAI-compatible model command. Reads a prompt on stdin, calls a chat-completions
# endpoint, and prints the model's review JSON on stdout. Used by runtime/generic.sh.
#
# Config (env): ASDD_RUNTIME_TOKEN (the API key, the repo secret), ASDD_MODEL_URL (the full
# chat-completions URL, e.g. https://<provider>/v1/chat/completions), ASDD_MODEL (the model name).
# Optional: ASDD_MODEL_RETRIES (default 3), ASDD_MODEL_RETRY_SLEEP seconds between tries (default 1).
# This holds NO GitHub write scope. It prints data; it never executes anything.
#
# Robustness: a model that honours response_format:json_object only intermittently can return
# prose-wrapped, fenced, or truncated output on any single call. So one flaky response does not drop the
# whole model review, this (1) sends an explicit system instruction to emit JSON only, (2) tolerantly
# extracts the JSON object from a response with surrounding prose or code fences, and (3) retries until
# it gets a valid JSON object. It prints one valid JSON object, or nothing if every attempt failed, in
# which case generic.sh fails closed to a human-review comment (the gate never sees a false pass).
