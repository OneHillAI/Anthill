# The Goose operator kit

The recipes that turn a blank [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) agent into a framework agent. Copy this folder into your repo (or let `init` do it), point the recipes at your models and MCP servers, and you have the operate layer running on unmodified Goose - no fork.

> These are **v0.1 templates**. Validate them against your installed Goose recipe schema; field names may drift with Goose releases.

## What's here

The **developer is bring-your-own** ([`standards/spec-driven.md`](../standards/spec-driven.md) OP.1): a deployment does not run a standing developer. A contributor connects their own coding agent, or the maintainer connects theirs. So the recipes a **deployment runs** are the governance + support agents:

- `test-author.yaml` - develops and extends the test suite from the spec, on a **different model** from the developer. Run on demand while a change is built.
- `test-runner.yaml` - runs the suite and reports pass/fail, on a **different model** from the developer. Together they satisfy `developer != test_author, test_runner` - the project independently tests the bring-your-own developer's work. In CI the runner runs only after a merge to main (`.github/workflows/asdd-test.yml`), never on an open PR.
- `documentation.yaml` - keeps docs / impact log / knowledge base in sync as a governed PR.
- `interaction.yaml` - the outer membrane: connects a chat/web surface, answers from the project's knowledge, and routes ideas into the governed intake as a validated spec (see [`agents/interaction.md`](../agents/interaction.md), [`agents/intake.md`](../agents/intake.md)). Use this for **trusted, members-only** channels.
- `interaction-public.yaml` - the **execution-free** variant for an **untrusted public** surface (a public Discord/Slack channel, the web widget): no shell, so an injection in an anonymous message cannot exfiltrate the model key. Answers from read-only knowledge and routes via `spec_check` only. See `agents/interaction.md`, "Public (untrusted) surfaces".

And, optional:

- `developer.yaml` - a **reference** recipe for those who choose to operate a developer via Goose (e.g. the maintainer's own). Reads an issue, plans the smallest change, writes code + tests + the doc/impact entry + the disclosure trailer, opens a governed PR. **Never self-merges.**

The four review lenses (code / security / spec / quality) and the merge-reviewer run in the CI gates (`.github/`) and in `agents/`, not as separate local recipes - the gate is the enforcement point.

## The one hard rule: `developer_model != test_model`

The developer and tester agents **MUST run different models** (ideally different families/providers). If the same model writes the code and its tests, their blind spots line up and the tests happily confirm the bug. Set:

```
developer.yaml:  goose_model = <model A>
test-runner.yaml: goose_model = <model B>   # B != A (test-author likewise)
```

A conforming setup refuses to run when they match. (Reference check: a `validate` step in `init` compares the two before first run.)

## Setup (developer-facing, ~5 minutes)

1. Install Goose (desktop or CLI) and configure a provider with `goose configure`. Goose integrates many providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, Ollama, ...); the recipes are **provider-neutral**, so you pick the model at setup. Provider selection is a deployment choice, not a framework one.
2. The recipes run out of the box on **Goose builtins** - each uses the bundled `developer` extension (shell + file editing: runs tests, reads diffs, drives `git`/`gh`) plus the `asdd-gates` MCP extension (the deterministic gates). **No external MCP is required for a minimal run.** Optionally add your own extensions - a GitHub MCP, an OKGF knowledge MCP, or (for the interaction agent) a Slack/Discord/web binding - by editing the recipe or with `goose run --with-extension "<cmd>"`.
3. Run each **deployment** recipe with its model, keeping the tester's model distinct from whatever builds the code (`developer != tester`):
   ```
   goose run --recipe recipes/test-runner.yaml   --model <tester-model>  --params pr=<PR>
   goose run --recipe recipes/documentation.yaml --model <doc-model>     --params instructed_by=<h> --params change_ref=<PR>
   goose run --recipe recipes/interaction.yaml   --model <public-model>  --params platform=<slack|web>
   ```
   The **developer** is bring-your-own, so `developer.yaml` is an optional reference. Every recipe passes `goose recipe validate`.
4. Flow: a contributor (or the maintainer's own agent) builds a change and opens a PR -> the tester + the CI review gates check it -> a human merges. The interaction agent brings ideas in from the public as validated specs.

The framework is model-agnostic and Anthill-independent: bring your own developer, your own models, your own knowledge brain (or none), your own lanes.

## Sharing and running by name

To run a recipe by bare name instead of a full path (`GOOSE_RECIPE_PATH`), hand someone a single recipe as a shareable deeplink (`goose recipe deeplink`), or fetch recipes from GitHub after the public flip (`GOOSE_RECIPE_GITHUB_REPO`), see [share and run the recipes by name](../docs/guides/distribute.md).

For the GitHub fetch, Goose reads `<name>/recipe.yaml` at the repo root. Those root copies (`tester/`, `documentation/`, `interaction/`) are generated from these canonical `recipes/*.yaml` by `cli/gen-recipe-dist.py`; edit the recipe here and regenerate, `run-base` fails if they drift.
